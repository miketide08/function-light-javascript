# Functional Lite Programming with JavaScript 

This project includes functional programming JavaScript exercises completed during Kyle Simpsons' 
Functional Light JavaScript v2 course. Some of the topics covered during this course included: pure functions
and sde-effects, immutability, closures, recursion, proper tail calls, trampolines, point-free-style, and
function composition. 

Also covered in the course were the map, filter, and reduce functions as well as currying, partials, fusion, 
transducing and lazy arrays.

I completed the solutions in ES6 syntax unlike the explanations in the course. A link to the course can be 
found below in the Acknowledgements section.
